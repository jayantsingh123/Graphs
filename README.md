## Overview
This repository is a collection of codes implemented in Python 3.12,  explaining various concepts and applications of Graph Data Structure. In addition to being a very complex Data Structure, Graph finds applications in various industries such as logistics, social networks etc. 


### Problem Types


a.) Find least cost for Directed Acyclic Graphs, using Dijkistras algorithm

b.) Check if we have a path from source to destination.

c.) Identify the node which can be accessed from every other node in the Graph, in otherwords most popular node in a Social Network.
